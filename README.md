## Git Basics

My impressions from the studied material:

> The only contact I had with Git before was in the form of a single button in VScode that "did things" after clicking. I perceived GitHub only as a cloud storage. Everything turned out to be much wider and deeper. The first tasks in [Courcera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) and [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) gave more new questions than answers, but I see this as a big plus, because I feel that the thirst for knowledge prompts me to work further.

My impressions from the studied material:

### Linux Survival

> Before starting the frontend course, I decided in advance to install Linux on my main computer. The advice from students in the chat prompted me to do this. If I had familiarized myself with the basic commands of the command line earlier, then, probably, Linux configuring would be much easier. Most of the learned commands are important and useful in everyday use, except maybe the commands for work with the printer.

### HTTP Basics

> This material was very difficult for me to understand, but quite interesting. I learned that the IP/TCP/HTTP protocols don't just work together, but do so at different levels of the hierarchy. I really liked the material about working with the cache, it became clear that it's very important for speed and traffic savings. I definitely want to try using the authorization mechanism in one of my future projects

## Git Collaboration

My impressions from the studied material:

>I bought a subscription to Coursera to access the checked labs and didn't regret it at all. This allowed me to experiment with Git functionality from the command line without the risk of getting confused and messing up my files since the entire lab process takes place on a test remote machine with an SSH connection. This practice helped a lot to consolidate the studied material.</br></br>
Learning Git Branching helped to visualize all the difficult moments to make it easier to imagine what happens after a particular command. In particular, it helped me realize that branches are in three states at the same time, and until the fetch command is executed, the main, origin/main locally located, and main remotely located branches can have different files and lines of code.</br></br>
I acquired more questions than answers, as after the previous task, so I feel an urgent need to take each of the courses at least once more to consolidate the material.
