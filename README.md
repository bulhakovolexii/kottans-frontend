## Git Basics

My impressions from the studied material:

> The only contact I had with Git before was in the form of a single button in VScode that "did things" after clicking.
> I perceived GitHub only as a cloud storage. Everything turned out to be much wider and deeper. The first tasks in
> [Coursera][2] and [Learn Git Branching][3] gave more new questions than answers, but I see this as a big plus, because
> I feel that the thirst for knowledge prompts me to work further.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

Screenshots of completed quizzes:

- [Linux Survival | Module 2](./task_linux_cli/quiz_2.png) (447,5 kB)

My impressions from the studied material:

### Linux Survival

> Before starting the frontend course, I decided in advance to install Linux on my main computer. The advice from
> students in the chat prompted me to do this. If I had familiarized myself with the basic commands of the command line
> earlier, then, probably, Linux configuring would be much easier. Most of the learned commands are important and useful
> in everyday use, except maybe the commands for work with the printer.

### HTTP Basics

> This material was very difficult for me to understand, but quite interesting. I learned that the IP/TCP/HTTP protocols
> don't just work together, but do so at different levels of the hierarchy. I really liked the material about working
> with the cache, it became clear that it's very important for speed and traffic savings. I definitely want to try using
> the authorization mechanism in one of my future projects

## Git Collaboration

Screenshots of completed quizzes:

- [Coursera | Introduction to Git and GitHub](./task_git_collaboration/git_course_result.pdf) (299,1 kB)
- [Learning Git Branching | Basics](./task_git_collaboration/branching_basics.png) (131,4 kB)
- [Learning Git Branching | Remote](./task_git_collaboration/branching_remote.png) (121,4 kB)

My impressions from the studied material:

> I bought a subscription to Coursera to access the checked labs and didn't regret it at all. This allowed me to
> experiment with Git functionality from the command line without the risk of getting confused and messing up my files
> since the entire lab process takes place on a test remote machine with an SSH connection. This practice helped a lot
> to consolidate the studied material. Learning Git Branching helped to visualize all the difficult moments to make it
> easier to imagine what happens after a particular command. In particular, it helped me realize that branches are in
> three states at the same time, and until the `fetch` command is executed, the `main`, `origin/main` locally located,
> and `main` remotely located branches can have different files and lines of code. I acquired more questions than
> answers, as after the previous task, so I feel an urgent need to take each of the courses at least once more to
> consolidate the material.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

Certificates of completed quizzes:

- [Coursera | HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers](./task_html_css_intro/html_css_js_coursera.pdf) (305,7 kB)
- [Learn HTML | Codecademy](./task_html_css_intro/html_codecademy.pdf) (47,9 kB)
- [Learn CSS | Codecademy](./task_html_css_intro/css_codecademy.pdf) (47,6 kB)

My impressions from the studied material:

> An enormous amount of time has passed since my last report, and I believe it is necessary to explain the reason.
> Firstly, I received a scholarship to study front-end under the "IT Generation" program. Participation in the
> competitive selection required a lot of effort and time, but these investments were fully justified. Secondly, I set a
> goal for myself, not only to pass the "sufficient" part of the courses offered but to master them completely and
> receive the appropriate certificates of completion of the courses. I was not prepared for the fact that these courses
> will contain the basics of OOP and Ajax, most of the material was not fully understood by me, and I will absolutely
> have to return to this later. Now I want to continue my studies with the Kottans, in parallel with the "IT
> Generation", according to the 2p2 scheme.
